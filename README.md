### Hi, I'm JosÃ© Alonso

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at KCL, working with @CemrgAppDevelopers, I also enjoy Matlab and did most of my PhD there, check my macrosight repository! 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything Matlab, C++ or programing in general. Happy to help. 

ðŸ“« The best way to reach me would be on my KCL email (look in my profile). 

I also have a website https://alonsojasl.github.io
